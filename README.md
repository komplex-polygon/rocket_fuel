# rocket_fuel
wellcome to my game that i made in C.

this game is right now just an space simulator but i have plans for more.
the specal thing with this game is that it uses unicode carecters to rendering and that makes it useble on headless computers. 
i have not made it work with ssh but im working on it.



# problems with ssh.
becuse the game uses the usb contoler for the input ssh will not work in the current moment.
i chose usb controler becuse it gave me the least delay and most reliebilety.




# To do.
1. optemize the rendering and refacter the code.
2. exspand on the game so it is fun.
