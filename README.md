# Rocket fuel
Welcome to my game that I made in C.

This game is right now just a space simulator but I have plans for more.
The special thing with this game is that it uses unicode characters for rendering and that makes it usable on headless computers.
i have not made it work with ssh but i'm working on it.

Sorry for the low bitrate. :3



# Problems with ssh
because the game uses the usb controller for the input ssh will not work in the current moment.
I chose the usb controller because it gave me the least delay and most reliability.




# To do
1. optimize the rendering and refactor the code.
2. expand on the game so it is fun.  :3





# About
This game was made by Mikael.back... and some parts ai (deepseek).
Ai did the low level stuff such as reading usb controller data and ANSI codes.
If you don't trust deepseeker you can read the code in the rock.c and judge by yourself if you want to run it.

Ps: This is the first time I program in C so don't judge me too much. ;3
